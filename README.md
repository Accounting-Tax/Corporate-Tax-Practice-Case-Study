# CTA3 2024 - CS2 Practice Case Study: Corporate Tax 

## Background Summary:
Smith Manufacturing & Distribution Company Ltd (Smith): Founded in 1940 Smith initially produced guns during WWII and later transitioned to manufacturing steel parts for cars. Sam Smith the original owner distributed shares to his children. After Sam’s death his son Fred took over expanding the business and venturing into new markets including a failed battery manufacturing venture that resulted in tax losses of $12 million. Family disagreements ensued and Fred eventually bought out his siblings' shares. Smith’s performance improved with a projected turnover of $25 million for FY24. Fred plans to borrow $200000 from the company in July 2024 to purchase a car.

Questions:
1. Australian Tax Residency of Smith WOFE Ltd:
   - Is Smith WOFE Ltd considered an Australian resident for tax purposes?
   - What if the Chinese subsidiary is an Australian resident?
2. Tax Loss Recoupment:
   - Can Smith recoup its tax losses in the 2024 income year?
3. Dividend Payment and Franking:
   - Can Smith pay a dividend out of current year profits despite prior losses?
   - If a dividend is paid what is the franking rate?
4. Debt Forgiveness Tax Consequences:
   - What are the tax implications for both the sibling lenders and Smith following the forgiveness of the debt?
5. CGT and Income Tax Consequences of Share Sale:
   - What are the CGT and income tax consequences for Fred and Smith if Fred sells his shares?
   - Is the business goodwill considered a pre- or post-CGT asset?
6. Tax Issues with Loan to Fred:
   - Are there income tax issues related to the $200000 loan made to Fred for purchasing a car?

Suggested Solutions:
Question 1: Australian Tax Residency of Smith WOFE Ltd
1. Corporate Residency Test: Smith WOFE Ltd is considered an Australian resident if it conducts business in Australia and has its central management and control (CMAC) in Australia or if its voting power is controlled by Australian residents.
2. Chinese Subsidiary Residency: If Smith WOFE Ltd has CMAC in Australia it is likely an Australian resident for tax purposes. Dual residency issues might arise with the China-Australia Double Tax Agreement (DTA) and the Multilateral Instrument (MLI) affecting tax treatment and requiring mutual agreement procedures.
Question 2: Tax Loss Recoupment
1. Continuity of Ownership Test (COT): Smith failed the COT when Fred acquired shares from his siblings necessitating satisfaction of the Business Continuity Test (BCT).
2. Business Continuity Test (BCT): Smith must show that it continues to operate a similar business to recoup tax losses verifying that business activities remain similar.
Question 3: Dividend Payment and Franking
1. Dividend Payment: Smith can pay a dividend if it meets the asset and liability requirements fairness and creditor protection criteria under section 254T of the Corporations Act.
2. Franking of Dividends: A dividend can be paid out of current profits despite prior losses. Smith can frank dividends at a maximum rate of 25% aligning with the benchmark rule and required reporting.
Question 4: Debt Forgiveness Tax Consequences
1. Commercial Debt Forgiveness: Under Division 245 the refinancing and debt forgiveness rules might apply. The value of shares issued in place of the debt should be compared with the market value to determine if any debt is forgiven.
2. Siblings' Tax Consequences: Siblings will not realize a capital loss from the debt forgiveness due to market value adjustments.
Question 5: CGT and Income Tax Consequences of Share Sale
1. CGT Treatment: Fred’s sale of shares will involve CGT event A1 for post-CGT shares and CGT event K6 for pre-CGT shares. The business goodwill is considered a pre-CGT asset.
2. Company Consequences: Smith faces no immediate tax consequences from Fred's share sale but must meet COT and BCT for further tax losses or adjustments.
Question 6: Tax Issues with Loan to Fred
1. Division 7A Implications: The $200000 loan to Fred for purchasing a car is subject to Division 7A deeming the loan as a dividend. Fred will include this as assessable income taxed at his marginal rate and it is unfrankable.
Code of Professional Conduct:
1. Ethical Issues: Advisors should avoid conflicts of interest such as advising both Fred and the buyer or manipulating financial records. They must also ensure they have the competence to handle due diligence tasks.
2. Potential Consequences: Violations may result in sanctions from the Tax Practitioners Board (TPB) including written cautions suspension or termination of registration.

Late Breaking Facts and Suggested Solutions:
Late Breaking Facts:
1. Refinanced Debt: Fred refinanced and repaid sibling loans using a bank loan in May 2023. Smith now owes Fred the principal and interest.
2. Share Subscription: Fred converted the debt into equity by subscribing for new shares in Smith in July 2023.
3. Dividend Payment: Smith paid a dividend on 1 July 2023 which was not fully franked but expected to be covered by future tax payments.
4. Acquisition by Baker Co Ltd: Smith was acquired by Baker and joined its tax consolidated group with a deficit franking account. A portion of the sale proceeds was deferred based on future performance.

Suggested Solutions:
Question 1: Deductibility of Refinanced Debt Costs
1. Interest Deductibility: Interest on the refinancing loan is deductible if incurred for income-producing purposes. Costs related to repaying the original sibling loans are also deductible.
2. Expenses: Costs associated with discharging the mortgage (e.g. penalty interest) are deductible if the original loan was used for income-producing purposes.
Question 2: Commercial Debt Forgiveness
1. Debt Forgiveness Provisions: Division 245’s rules apply to the refinancing and share subscription. Compare the market value of the shares issued to determine if any debt amount is forgiven.
Question 3: Franking of Dividend and Deficit Consequences
1. Dividend Frankability: The dividend paid on 1 July 2023 is frankable as it is not unfrankable under section 202-45.
2. Franking Account Deficit: Smith will be liable for franking deficit tax (FDT) if the franking account is in deficit at year-end or when joining a tax consolidated group. FDT can be offset against future tax liabilities but excess offsets may not be refundable. The FDT may be reduced if the deficit was due to uncontrollable events.
Question 4: CGT Consequences and Structuring
1. Deferred Payment Arrangement: The deferred amount in the sale of Smith shares is included in capital proceeds at CGT event A1. If not received it may reduce capital proceeds under section 116-45.
2. Preferred Structuring: Using a look-through earnout right (LTER) could defer taxation until the cash is received. This approach may be beneficial but could result in immediate taxation if the LTER does not qualify.
